# Faster Whisper transcription with CTranslate2

**faster-whisper** is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2/), which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models.

This implementation is up to 4 times faster than [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for the same accuracy while using less memory. The efficiency can be further improved with 8-bit quantization on both CPU and GPU.

## Benchmark

For `distil-whisper/distil-large-v2`, the WER is tested with code sample from [link](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v2#evaluation). for `faster-distil-whisper`, the WER is tested with setting:
```python
from faster_whisper import WhisperModel

model_size = "distil-large-v2"
# model_size = "distil-medium.en"
# Run on GPU with FP16
model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="float16")
segments, info = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", beam_size=5, language="en")
```

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or greater

Unlike openai-whisper, FFmpeg does **not** need to be installed on the system. The audio is decoded with the Python library [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV) which bundles the FFmpeg libraries in its package.

### GPU

GPU execution requires the following NVIDIA libraries to be installed:

* [cuBLAS for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas)
* [cuDNN 8 for CUDA 12](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

**Note**: Latest versions of `ctranslate2` support CUDA 12 only. For CUDA 11, the current workaround is downgrading to the `3.24.0` version of `ctranslate2` (This can be done with `pip install --force-reinsall ctranslate2==3.24.0` or specifying the version in a `requirements.txt`).

There are multiple ways to install the NVIDIA libraries mentioned above. The recommended way is described in the official NVIDIA documentation, but we also suggest other installation methods below. 

<details>
<summary>Other installation methods (click to expand)</summary>


**Note:** For all these methods below, keep in mind the above note regarding CUDA versions. Depending on your setup, you may need to install the _CUDA 11_ versions of libraries that correspond to the CUDA 12 libraries listed in the instructions below.

#### Use Docker

The libraries (cuBLAS, cuDNN) are installed in these official NVIDIA CUDA Docker images: `nvidia/cuda:12.0.0-runtime-ubuntu20.04` or `nvidia/cuda:12.0.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04`.

#### Install with `pip` (Linux only)

On Linux these libraries can be installed with `pip`. Note that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` must be set before launching Python.

```bash
pip install nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cudnn-cu12

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`python3 -c 'import os; import nvidia.cublas.lib; import nvidia.cudnn.lib; print(os.path.dirname(nvidia.cublas.lib.__file__) + ":" + os.path.dirname(nvidia.cudnn.lib.__file__))'`
```

**Note**: Version 9+ of `nvidia-cudnn-cu12` appears to cause issues due its reliance on cuDNN 9 (Faster-Whisper does not currently support cuDNN 9). Ensure your version of the Python package is for cuDNN 8.

#### Download the libraries from Purfview's repository (Windows & Linux)

Purfview's [whisper-standalone-win](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win) provides the required NVIDIA libraries for Windows & Linux in a [single archive](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases/tag/libs). Decompress the archive and place the libraries in a directory included in the `PATH`.

```

</details>

## Usage

### Faster-whisper

```python
from faster_whisper import WhisperModel

model_size = "large-v3"

# Run on GPU with FP16
model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="float16")

# or run on GPU with INT8
# model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="int8_float16")
# or run on CPU with INT8
# model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cpu", compute_type="int8")

segments, info = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", beam_size=5)

print("Detected language '%s' with probability %f" % (info.language, info.language_probability))

for segment in segments:
    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))
```

**Warning:** `segments` is a *generator* so the transcription only starts when you iterate over it. The transcription can be run to completion by gathering the segments in a list or a `for` loop:

```python
segments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3")
segments = list(segments)  # The transcription will actually run here.
```
### Faster Distil-Whisper

The Distil-Whisper checkpoints are compatible with the Faster-Whisper package. In particular, the latest [distil-large-v3](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v3)
checkpoint is intrinsically designed to work with the Faster-Whisper transcription algorithm. The following code snippet 
demonstrates how to run inference with distil-large-v3 on a specified audio file:

```python
from faster_whisper import WhisperModel

model_size = "distil-large-v3"

model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cuda", compute_type="float16")
segments, info = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", beam_size=5, language="en", condition_on_previous_text=False)

for segment in segments:
    print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (segment.start, segment.end, segment.text))
```

For more information about the distil-large-v3 model, refer to the original [model card](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v3).

### Word-level timestamps

```python
segments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", word_timestamps=True)

for segment in segments:
    for word in segment.words:
        print("[%.2fs -> %.2fs] %s" % (word.start, word.end, word.word))
```

### VAD filter

The library integrates the [Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) model to filter out parts of the audio without speech:

```python
segments, _ = model.transcribe("audio.mp3", vad_filter=True)
```

The default behavior is conservative and only removes silence longer than 2 seconds. See the available VAD parameters and default values in the [source code](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/blob/master/faster_whisper/vad.py). They can be customized with the dictionary argument `vad_parameters`:

```python
segments, _ = model.transcribe(
    "audio.mp3",
    vad_filter=True,
    vad_parameters=dict(min_silence_duration_ms=500),
)
```

### Logging

The library logging level can be configured like this:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger("faster_whisper").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Going further

See more model and transcription options in the [`WhisperModel`](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/blob/master/faster_whisper/transcribe.py) class implementation.

## Model conversion

When loading a model from its size such as `WhisperModel("large-v3")`, the corresponding CTranslate2 model is automatically downloaded from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/Systran).

We also provide a script to convert any Whisper models compatible with the Transformers library. They could be the original OpenAI models or user fine-tuned models.

For example the command below converts the [original "large-v3" Whisper model](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3) and saves the weights in FP16:

```bash
pip install transformers[torch]>=4.23

ct2-transformers-converter --model openai/whisper-large-v3 --output_dir whisper-large-v3-ct2
--copy_files tokenizer.json preprocessor_config.json --quantization float16
```

* The option `--model` accepts a model name on the Hub or a path to a model directory.
* If the option `--copy_files tokenizer.json` is not used, the tokenizer configuration is automatically downloaded when the model is loaded later.

Models can also be converted from the code. See the [conversion API](https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/python/ctranslate2.converters.TransformersConverter.html).

### Load a converted model

1. Directly load the model from a local directory:
```python
model = faster_whisper.WhisperModel("whisper-large-v3-ct2")
```

2. [Upload your model to the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_sharing#upload-with-the-web-interface) and load it from its name:
```python
model = faster_whisper.WhisperModel("username/whisper-large-v3-ct2")
```

## Comparing performance against other implementations

If you are comparing the performance against other Whisper implementations, you should make sure to run the comparison with similar settings. In particular:

* Verify that the same transcription options are used, especially the same beam size. For example in openai/whisper, `model.transcribe` uses a default beam size of 1 but here we use a default beam size of 5.
* When running on CPU, make sure to set the same number of threads. Many frameworks will read the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, which can be set when running your script:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 python3 my_script.py
```
